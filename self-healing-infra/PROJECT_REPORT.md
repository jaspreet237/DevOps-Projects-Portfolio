elf-Healing Infrastructure with Terraform, Docker, and Prometheus Alertmanager

Objective

To implement a self-healing system where containerized services automatically recover from failures using monitoring and automated remediation.

Tools & Technologies

Terraform → Infrastructure provisioning (Nginx container + monitoring stack)

Docker & Docker Compose → Containerization

Prometheus → Metrics collection

Alertmanager → Alert notifications

Amtool + jq → Automated response scripts for alert remediation

Grafana → Metrics visualization

Architecture

Terraform provisions an Nginx container alongside a monitoring stack.

Prometheus scrapes container health metrics.

Alertmanager is configured with alert rules (e.g., if Nginx goes down).

On failure, alerts are sent and parsed using amtool + jq.

Automated script triggers a container restart → achieving self-healing.

Workflow

Define infrastructure in Terraform → deploy Nginx + monitoring containers.

Configure Prometheus rules for uptime monitoring.

Setup Alertmanager + webhook → execute auto-recovery scripts.

Simulate failure by stopping Nginx → system auto-recovers.

Outcome

Fully automated self-healing of Nginx container failures.

Monitoring + recovery demonstrated without human intervention.

Validated a resilient DevOps monitoring pipeline.
